    <h1 class="whoSec2h1">Yoga Is For Those Who Think...</h1>
    <div class="whoSec2div1">
      <div class="">
        <h2 class="whoSec2h1">They Aren’t Flexible Enough</h2>
        <p>Yoga isn’t about getting as far as you can into a pose, it’s about meeting yourself where you’re at in the moment. Through that acceptance and surrender you may find your body releasing and you’ll realize that there’s more to yoga than
          stretching.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2 class="whoSec2h1">They Aren’t Spiritual Enough</h2>
        <p>If you’re put off by the thought of chanting Om, choose a class with a more physical focus. There are plenty out there that will guide you through mindful movement, without mentioning chanting once.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2 class="whoSec2h1">Performing Poses Is Silly</h2>
        <p>If you’re really not keen on practicing yoga postures, try a meditation class. The original purpose of Hatha yoga asanas was to prepare the body for meditation. So skip straight to that. You’ll get the benefits of understanding the nature
          of mind and reconnecting with your inner Self.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="whoSec2div1">
      <div class="">
        <h2 class="whoSec2h1">They're Too Anxious</h2>
        <p>For those of us who suffer from anxiety, Yin yoga can be amazing for learning to become present with uncomfortable thoughts and emotions without becoming entangled in their narrative. If stillness is too big a challenge at the moment then
          a flowing vinyasa class might initially be more soothing for the mind.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2 class="whoSec2h1">They're Too Lazy</h2>
        <p>Try restorative yoga, the hardest part is getting there. Once you’re on the mat, simply get into the most comfortable position possible, supported by cushions, bolsters and blankets. Who knows, once you've reconnected with your inner Self
          through restorative yoga</p>
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <h2 class="whoSec2h1">Yoga Is Only for Girls</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of guy-friendly classes out there. The stereotype of yoga being full of girls in brightly-colored Lycra yoga pants is out of date (don’t get me wrong, there are still plenty of those!). These days everyone’s doing yoga,
          from rugby players to office workers to power-lifters. </p>
